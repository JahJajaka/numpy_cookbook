There are plenty high level tools which try to simplify life of ML practitioner, but if you want to go deeper, you won't pass by Numpy library. It does exactly what each ML practitioner needs: efficient operations with multidimensional arrays. Recently I dedicated some free time to understand this great library. Here a Google Colab notebook with solutions of most common problems organized in easy for search way. Most information taken from: this [Numpy cheat sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/python-numpy-cheat-sheet), this [blog](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-numpy-exercises-python/), and this [Github project](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100). I left my solutions in some exercises accompanying by performance checks. Thanks
